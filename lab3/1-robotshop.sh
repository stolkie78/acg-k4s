#Clone the Git repo that contains the pre-made descriptors:
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/robot-shop.git
#ince this application has many components, it is a good idea to create a separate namespace for the app:
kubectl create namespace robot-shop
#Deploy the app to the cluster:
kubectl -n robot-shop create -f ~/robot-shop/K8s/descriptors/
#Check the status of the application's pods:
kubectl get pods -n robot-shop
#You should be able to reach the robot shop app from your browser using the Kube master node's public IP:
http://$kube_master_public_ip:30080
